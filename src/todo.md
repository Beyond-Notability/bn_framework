All the dates
------------
 
- category filters


Childbirth
----------

- Plot.axis to show label at both top and bottom is not working (cf education) and Idk why (lowish priority: not essential but desirable given that it's a tall chart, and for consistency between similar charts)


Education
--------

- add BM chart (needs to be componentized)
- custom d3 shapes? (esp for start/end pairs)
- better sharing code between the two tables 


Residence
--------

- examples of people with gaps: look at place data between those gaps, does it help explain absent residence data? 



Networks
-------

- make highlight connections on click work properly!!!!
- filters
- work out how to componentize the fkg thing?
